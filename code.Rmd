## Load packages

The packages necessary for this analysis..

```{r}
library(readr)
```

To start, we read the previously prepared table of Genera and number of individuals per plant, and calculate the main diversity indices: abundance (N), richness (S), diversity (Shannon's H'), evenness (Pielou's J) and Simpson index (herein referred as "Lambda" in the script). Indices are calculated with functions from vegan package and saved to a new table ("Indices.xlsx"):

## Data import

Let's first import the data. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- read_delim("data/data.csv", delim = ";")
data
```

## Data tidy

Data wrangling here.

## Data transformation

We need to do some transformations, create new variables, etc.

## Data visualization

Produce some plots to understand the data

## Data analysis

Modeling

## Manuscript-ready plots

This could be shown here or in a separate webpage.
